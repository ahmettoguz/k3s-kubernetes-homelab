Q2) If the application running inside the container uses web sessions and the application runs on multiple instances, how can you ensure the session's not broken in consecutive requests?
Answer:

Main aim of the session is storing user's temporary information in a file which keep on service.
With the help of the session and cookie authentication and additional informations provided as persistent between different http requests.
Tokens (generally jwt) are recommended solutions for micro service architecture instead of sessions.
But if the system is implemented with sessions in micro service architecture, some modification needed as session files stored in services and each requests distributed among services.
Redis is seem one of the best solution for distributed session management.
With Redis Cluster there are Redis nodes and these nodes split dataset among these multiple nodes. So services communicate with that redis nodes to get the session data.
